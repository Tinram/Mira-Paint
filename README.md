#### Mira Fractal demo using the Gumowski-Mira equation.


The Gumowski-Mira equation was developed at CERN in 1980 by I. Gumowski and C. Mira to calculate the trajectories of sub-atomic particles.


## Build

Using the Flex compiler on Linux / Windows:

        ./mxmlc MiraPaint.as

        mxmlc MiraPaint.as


## Execute

Most browsers, because of revised security, will not now load a Flash *.swf* directly.

*MiraRunner.html* and the *js/* directory provide old code to load and execute *MiraPaint.swf* in a browser.
